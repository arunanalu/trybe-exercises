# Day 3.3

**I studied more** about CSS, highlighting that:

   - I learned a lot about **selectors**
   - I learned about **divs, box model and inline** (exercise 1)
   - I learned positioning through **position, top, left, z-index** (exercise 2)
   - I learned about **pseudo class** (exercise 3 and 4)
   - Trained to style tags using the ID selector, and repeated the process using only a pseudo class ': nth-child ()' and ': nth-of-type ()' (exercise 5)
