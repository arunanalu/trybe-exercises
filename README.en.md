# Wellcome to my exercise repository !

Here you will find all exercises that I do as a **Trybe** studend of web development, and you be able to follow the **evolution of my learning** until I become a profissional **fullstack** able to meet the needs of market.

The exercises are organized as follows

Separation by blocks, exemple:
> B2 - refers to the second block of studies

Separation by days, exemple:
> 3.2 - refers to the second day of third block 

Inside each block, you will find other README summarizing the contents of the block and, each day, another README with notes on what I learned while studying that day.
